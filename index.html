        <h2>How Thomas Edison Made It</h2>
        <p>Thomas Alva Edison worked very hard to make the lightbulb. He tried many different materials for the filament until he found one that worked well. He did lots of experiments in his laboratory and never gave up even when things didn't work. After many tries, he finally made a lightbulb that could last for a long time, and this changed how people lived because they could have light whenever they wanted.</p>
